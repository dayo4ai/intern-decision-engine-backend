# TICKET-101 Review

## Strengths
- Well-structured codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Good exception handling
- Clear documentation
- Proper input validation

## Areas for Improvement
1. Code should follow SOLID principles more closely:
   - Separate credit scoring logic
   - Extract credit modifier determination
   - Create interfaces for major components
   
2. Make the system more extensible:
   - Allow for different scoring algorithms
   - Support multiple credit modifier strategies
   - Prepare for future country-specific rules

3. Improve configuration management:
   - Move magic numbers to configuration
   - Make credit modifiers configurable

## Recommended Actions
1. Implement interface-based design for core components
2. Extract scoring logic to separate class
3. Create strategy pattern for credit modifier determination
4. Add configuration management for business rules
